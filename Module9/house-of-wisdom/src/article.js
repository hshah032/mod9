            Know, O beloved, that man was not created in jest or at random, but marvelously made
and for some great end. Although he is not from everlasting, yet he lives for ever; and
though his body is mean and earthly, yet his spirit is lofty and divine. When in the
crucible of abstinence he is purged from carnal passions he attains to the highest, and in
place of being a slave to lust and anger becomes endued with angelic qualities. Attaining
that state, he finds his heaven in the contemplation of Eternal Beauty, and no longer in
fleshly delights. The spiritual alchemy which operates this change in him, like that which
transmutes base metals into gold, is not easily discovered, nor to be found in the house of
every old woman. It is to explain that alchemy and its methods of operation that the
author has undertaken this work, which he has entitled, The Alchemy of Happiness. Now
the treasuries of God, in which this alchemy is to be sought, are the hearts of the
prophets, and he who seeks it elsewhere will be disappointed and bankrupt on the day of
judgment when he hears the word, "We have lifted the veil from off thee, and thy sight
to-day is keen."
God has sent on earth a hundred and twenty-four thousand prophets [1] to teach men the
prescription of this alchemy, and how to purify their hearts from baser qualities in the
crucible of abstinence. This alchemy may be briefly described as turning away from the
world to God, and its constituents are four: 
</p>
<p>
1. The knowledge of self. 
2. The knowledge of God. 
3. The knowledge of this world as it really is. 
4. The knowledge of the next world as it really is.
We shall now proceed to expound these four constituents in order.
</p>
<p>
THE KNOWLEDGE OF SELF
Knowledge of self is the key to the knowledge of God, according to the saying: "He who
knows himself knows God," [1] and, as it is written in the Koran, "We will show them
Our signs in the world and in themselves, that the truth may be manifest to them." Now
nothing is nearer to thee than thyself, and if thou knowest not thyself how canst thou
know anything else? If thou sayest "I know myself," meaning thy outward shape, body,
face, limbs, and so forth, such knowledge can never be a key to the knowledge of God.
Nor, if thy knowledge as to that which is within only extends so far, that when thou art
hungry thou eatest, and when thou art angry thou attackest someone, wilt thou progress
any further in this path, for the beasts are thy partners in this? But real self-knowledge
consists in knowing the following things: What art thou in thyself, and from whence hast
thou come? Whither art thou going, and for what purpose hast thou come to tarry here
awhile, and in what does thy real happiness and misery consist? Some of thy attributes
are those of animals, some of devils, and some of angels, and thou hast to find out to
which of these attributes are accidental and which essential. Till thou knowest this, thou
canst not find out where thy real happiness lies. The occupation of animals is eating,
sleeping, and fighting; therefore, if thou art an animal, busy thyself in these things. Devils
are busy in stirring up mischief, and in guile and deceit; if thou belongest to them, do
their work. Angels contemplate the beauty of God, and are entirely free from animal
qualities, if thou art of angelic nature, then strive towards thine origin, that thou mayest
know and contemplate the Most High, and be delivered from the thraldom of lust and
anger. Thou shouldest also discover why thou hast been created with these two animal
instincts: whether that they should subdue and lead thee captive, or whether that thou
shouldest subdue them, and, in thy upward progress, make of one thy steed and of the
other thy weapon.

<p>
The first step to self-knowledge is to know that thou art composed of an outward shape,
called the body, and an inward entity called the heart, or soul. By "heart" I do not mean
the piece of flesh situated in the left of our bodies, but that which uses all the other
faculties as its instruments and servants. In truth it does not belong to the visible world,
but to the invisible, and has come into this world as a traveller visits a foreign country for
the sake of merchandise, and will presently return to its native land. It is the knowledge
of this entity and its attributes which is the key to the knowledge of God.
Some idea of the reality of the heart. or spirit, may be obtained by a man closing his eyes
and forgetting everything around except his individuality. He will thus also obtain a
glimpse of the unending nature of that individuality. Too close inquiry, however, into the
essence of spirit is forbidden by the Law. In the Koran it is written: "They will question
thee concerning the spirit. Say: 'The Spirit comes by the command of my Lord'." Thus
much is known of it that it is an indivisible essence belonging to the world of decrees,
and that it is not from everlasting, but created. An exact philosophical knowledge of the
spirit is not a necessary preliminary to walking in the path of religion, but comes rather as
